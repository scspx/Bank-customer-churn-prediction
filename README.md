# Bank-customer-churn-prediction
We will test different models and machine learning techniques to determine which one is the most accurate for bank customer churn prediction.

### Introduction
In phase 1, we had decided to conduct this project on Environmental Impact of Food Production. However, during the conduction of CRISP-DM
methodology we encounter our first issue: the lack of useful datasets on this regard. Therefore, we decided to change our Project Domain to Financial
and as a result also the Research Questions.
In order to develop this project, we have decided to follow CRISP-DM model. Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining is a model which
describes the life cycle of data science. It works as a guide in order to plan, organize and implement machine learning. This process is divided into six
phases such as Business Understanding, Data Understanding, Data Preparation, Modelling, Evaluation and Deployment (CRISP-DM - Data Science Process Alliance, 2021).
